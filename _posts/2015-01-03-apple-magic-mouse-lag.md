Quick to accuse Yosemite, but I was wrong...this time. Against my better judgment I upgraded my work Macbook Pro (Retina - Late 2013) to Yosemite just over a month ago now.  I encountered a lot of problems previously reported such as Filevault and Spotlight indexing slowing the machine down to a crawl.

I also recently noticed that I was getting an incredible amount of lag when using the Bluetooth Apple Magic Mouse.  There wasn't a problem before the upgrade so I assumed this was another Yosemite problem, and so it seemed my fears had been confirmed when I searched the web for other tales of woe, there were dozens of reports.  I tried all sorts of suggestions such as reseting the PRAM, nothing worked.

Then I came across several posts that dated back a few years where people had issues, these all pre-dated Yosemite obviously.  A lot spoke about Wi-Fi routers and how the 2.4ghz variety operate on the same frequency as the Bluetooth Magic Mouse.  Then things clicked into place.  I had recently changed the channels on my WiFi router because of a new neighbor throwing a lot of noise over my signal.

Not expecting much I changed channels again on my router on the 2.4ghz channel.  And Presto!  No more lag.  So I truly apologize to you Apple.  You have made a bit of a pigs ear of the Yosemite roll out, but this one wasn't down to you.
