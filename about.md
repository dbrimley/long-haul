	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Dave Brimley</h1>
	<p class="intro">Crafted Bytes is the personal website of David Brimley.  That's me, so enough of writing in the third person.  I travel the world helping people make sense of In Memory Data Grids.  If you're about to embark on a project that is converting between IMDG vendors or if you need some training, I may be able to help you.</p>
	<p>I've been working with IMDGs like Hazelcast, Oracle Coherence and Gemfire for some time.</p>
  <p>My current areas of interest are in Distributed Computing, In Memory Data Grids and High Frequency Trading Systems.</p>
	<h2>My Resume</h2>
  <p>20 years experience in the IT industry, 16 of which have been spent in the Investment Banking Sector (Fixed Income and Equities).  My primary expertise is server side Java, developing highly concurrent, high throughput systems.  </p>

<p>I like to utilize T/BDD and Agile techniques where the project allows and I strive to develop clean easily readable code.  In the past 7 years I have developed an understanding of caching technologies such as Oracle Coherence and VMware Gemfire, using these with great success to deliver multi region, highly available front office systems.</p>

<p>I have experience in leading and mentoring development teams in-house and offshore. I am equally happy working within a team as a senior developer or tech lead.  I enjoy helping others adopt agile techniques and to develop good OOD principles.</p>
