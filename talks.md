   I am a freelance consultant, so I'm always interested to hear about new projects that I might help out on.  I can work short term or long term assignments and I usually like to have a handful of things on the go at one time.  I'm also a keen speaker and trainer, so if you need some guidance on your next IMDG or Distributed Systems project just drop me a line.
